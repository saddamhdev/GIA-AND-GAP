Perfect question — and the **best answer is: *both*, but in the right order** 😉

Here’s the **exact path I recommend for you** (based on your background + enterprise goals):

# 🧭 The Smart Way: **Step-by-Step Tutorial → Starter Repo**

## Why not jump straight to a repo?

If you start only with a ready repo:

* You’ll **run** it ✅
* But you won’t **think like an architect** ❌
* In interviews, you’ll struggle to **explain *why* GIA/GAP exists**

Banks don’t hire “repo runners”.
They hire people who can **design, justify, and evolve architecture**.

---

## 🥇 Phase 1 — **Step-by-Step Tutorial (PRIMARY)**

### What you’ll learn (not copy-paste)

* Why **GAP ≠ GIA**
* Where **logic must NOT live**
* How **change isolation** works
* How banks avoid breaking 30 systems with 1 change

### Output of Phase 1

You’ll be able to say:

> “I designed and implemented a GIA–GAP architecture from scratch.”

That sentence alone is gold.

---

### 🪜 Step breakdown (what we’ll actually do)

#### Step 1️⃣ GAP API Gateway (Day 1)

* Spring Cloud Gateway
* Route → GIA
* Global error format
* No business logic

You’ll understand:

> “Why gateway filters are dangerous if misused”

---

#### Step 2️⃣ GAP Security (Day 2)

* JWT validation
* Role-based routing
* Channel separation (mobile/web/banker)

You’ll understand:

> “Why auth never belongs in GIA”

---

#### Step 3️⃣ First GIA Service (Day 3)

* `gia-origination-proxy`
* Validation
* Orchestration
* Aggregation

You’ll understand:

> “Why GIA is NOT a gateway”

---

#### Step 4️⃣ Core Services (Day 4)

* customer-service
* credit-service

You’ll understand:

> “Why core services must be dumb but perfect”

---

#### Step 5️⃣ Enterprise patterns (Day 5)

* Idempotency
* Retry vs Circuit Breaker
* Audit trail
* Correlation ID

You’ll understand:

> “Why banks survive outages”

---

## 🥈 Phase 2 — **Ready-Made Starter Project Repo (AFTER tutorial)**

### What the repo gives you

* Proper folder naming (bank-style)
* Clean separation of concerns
* OpenAPI-first contracts
* Docker-ready setup
* CV / LinkedIn showcase

### Repo structure (you’ll recognize every line)

```
gia-gap-platform/
├── gap/
│   ├── gap-api-gateway
│   ├── gap-auth-service
│
├── gia/
│   ├── gia-origination-proxy
│   ├── gia-payment-proxy
│
├── core/
│   ├── customer-service
│   ├── credit-service
│
├── docs/
│   ├── architecture.png
│   ├── flow-diagrams/
```

Because you learned step-by-step:

* You can **modify** it
* You can **extend** it
* You can **defend** it in interviews

## 🧠 This matches REAL banking training

Banks do this exact way:

1. Architecture walkthrough
2. Controlled implementation
3. Reference implementation

You’re basically getting **internal bank training**.

## 🏁 Final recommendation (short & honest)

| Option                  | Use when               |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ✅ Step-by-step tutorial | Learning & interviews  |
| ✅ Starter repo          | Portfolio & production |
| ❌ Only repo             | Shallow understanding  |

## 🔥 Next move (your call)

Say **one** of these and we start immediately:

1️⃣ **“Start Step 1: GAP API Gateway”**
2️⃣ **“Give me the full learning plan PDF-style”**
3️⃣ **“Show me a real banking use-case first”**

I’ll follow your lead 👌
